# Deep-DPG-TORCS
Using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients for an agent in the TORCS environment.

The model uses Actor Critic algorithm that uses both value iteration and policy iteration to optimize the action to take in the environment, maximizing the rewards based on the states.

Actor-Critic model:
